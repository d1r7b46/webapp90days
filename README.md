**Tips for Success for those that have ADHD:**
1. Break the study sessions into short, focused blocks with regular breaks to maintain attention.
2. Use interactive learning methods, such as online labs, capture-the-flag (CTF) challenges, and videos.
3. Create a quiet and organized study environment to minimize distractions.
4. Utilize task lists, timers, and study apps to help with time management and focus.
5. Consider joining a study group or finding an accountability partner to stay motivated and engaged.
6. Celebrate achievements and progress throughout the 90 days to boost morale.
